# Bringo - Download to CSV

Download all Bringo products, from a specific store, to a CSV file. This makes it easier to find and filter products based on category, brand name or price.  There's also a link to the product photo, if it has one. 

## Usage

### Linux

This script requires the `jq` JSON parser package.

Syntax: `bringo.sh [StoreName]`

### Windows

First you must enable scripts. This is required only once. Run powershell as Adiministrator and enter `Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` . Answer YES when asked. After this you can close powershell.

Right click on the script file `bringo.ps1` and select Run with PowerShell.
